# wikipediaOle
Innovative, responsive wikipedia frontend optimized for mobile devices
## Incentive
The "normal" way of reading wikipedia articles in a webbrowser is no more up-to-date: A giant amount of text is scrollable in only one dimension. It does not have to be that way. This project aims at using the hierarchical structure of such articles. The navigation within an article is handed over to the bottom of the page so that one can use it with a single hand. In addition, multiple wikipedia tabs are possible on one page and it has progressive web app-functionality including offline storage and a home screen icon.
## Usage
Open https://peteole.github.io/wikipediaOle/home.html , favorably on your smartphone. Then swipe the tiles on the bottom to navigate in the page. Swipe them down to get a level deeper into the article. If you swipe all the way up you get to the settings menu.
